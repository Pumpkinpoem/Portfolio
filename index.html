        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Andreas, a passionate full-stack developer from Sweden based in
          Rijeka, Croatia. I’ve always been fascinated by technology, and after
          completing my education at Code Institute, I dove headfirst into the
          world of coding. I love the thrill of solving problems and creating
          dynamic applications that can change the way we interact with the
          digital world. When I’m not buried in code, you can find me playing
          the latest fantasy RPGs, rocking out to some killer metal tunes, or
          gathering with friends for a D&D session. I’m always on the lookout
          for new challenges and opportunities to grow in my career. My goal is
          to become a lead developer, working on innovative projects that make a
          difference.

                        <h3>A Cup of Fiction/h3>
                        <p>This project is a dynamic social media platform designed
                          specifically for book clubs. It allows users to connect, share
                          recommendations, and discuss their favorite reads in a vibrant
                          community setting. As the lead developer, I designed and
                          implemented the front-end using React, creating a
                          user-friendly interface that enhances the user experience. The
                          back-end was built with Django REST Framework, ensuring
                          seamless data management and retrieval. Additionally, I
                          integrated PostgreSQL for robust data storage and utilized
                          Cloudinary for efficient media storage, enabling users to
                          upload and share images effortlessly.</p>
